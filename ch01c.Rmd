## pipes

The first thing for any ggplot is that we need to specify what data should be 
used to make the plot. We do so by using what is called a "pipe", which works as 
follows:

```{r}
# The following two lines of code mean the exact same thing:
names(iris)
# or this:
iris %>% 
  names()

# In other words, using the pipe ( %>% ) basically takes the first line, and 
# "pipes" it in as the first input of the function on the next line.
# So iris %>% names() basically tells the computer, take iris and put it in as 
# the first input for the names function, which is the equivalent of names(iris)

```

Now that we know how piping works, let's create a simple histogram of the 
variable `Sepal.Length`.
