Legends {#CHAPTER_LEGEND}
=======

Like the x- or y-axis, a legend is a guide: it shows people how to map
visual (aesthetic) properties back to data values.

Removing the Legend {#RECIPE_LEGEND_REMOVE}
-------------------

### Problem

You want to remove the legend from a graph.

### Solution

Use guides(), and specify the scale that should have its legend removed
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-REMOVE)):

```{r}
# The base plot (with legend)
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()
p

# Remove the legend for fill
p + guides(fill=FALSE)
```

![Left: default appearance; right: with legend
removed](figs/rgcb_1001.png)

### Discussion

Another way to remove a legend is to set guide=FALSE in the scale. This
will result in the exact same output as the preceding code:

```{r}
# Remove the legend for fill
p + scale_fill_discrete(guide=FALSE)
```

Yet another way to remove the legend is to use the theming system. If
you have more than one aesthetic mapping with a legend (color and shape,
for example), this will remove legends for all of them:

```{r}
p + theme(legend.position="none")
```

Sometimes a legend is redundant, or it is supplied in another graph that
will be displayed with the current one. In these cases, it can be useful
to remove the legend from a graph.

In the example used here, the colors provide the same information that
is on the x-axis, so the legend is unnecessary. Notice that with the
legend removed, the area used for graphing the data is larger. If you
want to achieve the same proportions in the graphing area, you will need
to adjust the overall dimensions of the graph.

When a variable is mapped to fill, the default scale used is
scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete() (equivalent to
scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue()), which maps the factor levels to
colors that are equally spaced around the color wheel. There are other
scales for fill, such as scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$manual(). If you
use scales for other aesthetics, such as colour (for lines and points)
or shape (for points), you must use the appropriate scale. Commonly used
scales include:

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$grey()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$brewer()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$discrete()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$hue()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$grey()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$brewer()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$shape\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$linetype()

Changing the Position of a Legend {#RECIPE_LEGEND_POSITION}
---------------------------------

### Problem

You want to move the legend from its default place on the right side.

### Solution

Use theme(legend.position=...). It can be put on the top, left, right,
or bottom by using one of those strings as the position
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-POSITION), left):

```{r}
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Pastel2")

p + theme(legend.position="top")
```

![Left: legend on top; right: legend inside of graphing
area](figs/rgcb_1002.png)

The legend can also be placed inside the graphing area by specifying a
coordinate position, as in legend.position=c(1,0)
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-POSITION), right). The coordinate space
starts at (0, 0) in the bottom left and goes to (1, 1) in the top right.

### Discussion

You can also use legend.justification to set which *part* of the legend
box is set to the position at legend.position. By default, the center of
the legend (.5, .5) is placed at the coordinate, but it is often useful
to specify a different point.

For example, this will place the bottom-right corner of the legend (1,0)
in the bottom-right corner of the graphing area (1,0):

```{r}
p + theme(legend.position=c(1,0), legend.justification=c(1,0))
```

![Left: legend in bottom-right corner; right: legend in top-right
corner.](figs/rgcb_1003.png)

And this will place the top-right corner of the legend in the top-right
corner of the graphing area, as in the graph on the right in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-POSITION-JUSTIFICATION):

```{r}
p + theme(legend.position=c(1,1), legend.justification=c(1,1))
```

When placing the legend inside of the graphing area, it may be helpful
to add an opaque border to set it apart
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-POSITION-BACKGROUND), left):

```{r}
p + theme(legend.position=c(.85,.2)) +
    theme(legend.background=element_rect(fill="white", colour="black"))
```

![Left: legend with opaque background and outline; right: with no
background or outlines](figs/rgcb_1004.png)

You can also remove the border around its elements so that itblends in
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-POSITION-BACKGROUND), right):

```{r}
p + theme(legend.position=c(.85,.2)) +
    theme(legend.background=element_blank()) +  # Remove overall border
    theme(legend.key=element_blank())           # Remove border around each item
```

Changing the Order of Items in a Legend {#RECIPE_LEGEND_ORDER}
---------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to change the order of the items in a legend.

### Solution

Set the limits in the scale to the desired order
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-ORDER)):

```{r}
# The base plot
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()
p

# Change the order of items
p + scale_fill_discrete(limits=c("trt1", "trt2", "ctrl"))
```

![Left: default order for legend; right: modified
order](figs/rgcb_1005.png)

### Discussion

Note that the order of the items on the x-axis did not change. To do
that, you would have to set the limits of
scale\$\$\_\$\$x\$\$\_\$\$discrete() ([???](#RECIPE_AXIS_ORDER)), or
change the data to have a different factor level order
([???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_REORDER)).

In the preceding example, group was mapped to the fill aesthetic. By
default this uses scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete() (which is the
sameas scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue()), which maps the factor levels
to colors that are equally spaced around the color wheel. We could have
used a different scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$*xxx*(), though. For
example, we could use a grey palette
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-ORDER2), left):

```{r}
p + scale_fill_grey(start=.5, end=1, limits=c("trt1", "trt2", "ctrl"))
```

Or we could use a palette from RColorBrewer
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-ORDER2), right):

```{r}
p + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Pastel2", limits=c("trt1", "trt2", "ctrl"))
```

![Left: modified order with a grey palette; right: with a palette from
RColorBrewer](figs/rgcb_1006.png)

All the previous examples were for fill. If you use scales for other
aesthetics, such as colour (for lines and points) or shape (for points),
you must use the appropriate scale. Commonly used scales include:

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$grey()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$brewer()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$discrete()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$hue()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$grey()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$brewer()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$shape\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$linetype()

By default, using scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete() is equivalent
to using scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue(); the same is true for color
scales.

Reversing the Order of Items in a Legend {#RECIPE_LEGEND_REVERSE}
----------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to reverse the order of items in a legend.

### Solution

Add guides(fill=guide\$\$\_\$\$legend(reverse=TRUE)) toreverse the order
of the legend, as in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE-REVERSE) (for
other aesthetics, replace fill with the name of the aesthetic, such as
colour or size):

```{r}
# The base plot
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()
p

# Reverse the legend order
p + guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))
```

![Left: default order for legend; right: reversed
order](figs/rgcb_1007.png)

### Discussion

It is also possible to control the legend when specifying the scale, as
in the following:

```{r}
scale_fill_hue(guide=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))
```

Changing a Legend Title {#RECIPE_LEGEND_TITLE_TEXT}
-----------------------

### Problem

You want to change the text of a legend title.

### Solution

Use labs() and setthe value of fill, colour, shape, or whatever
aesthetic is appropriate for the legend
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE)):

```{r}
# The base plot
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()
p

# Set the legend title to "Condition"
p + labs(fill="Condition")
```

![With the legend title set to "Condition"](figs/rgcb_1008.png)

### Discussion

It's also possible to set the title of the legend in the scale
specification. Since legends and axes are both guides, this works the
same way as setting the title of the x- or y-axis.

This would have the same effect as the previous code:

```{r}
p + scale_fill_discrete(name="Condition")
```

If there are multiple variables mapped to aesthetics with a legend
(those other than x and y), you can set the title of each individually.
In the example here we'll use \$\$\\\$\$n to add a line break in one
of the titles (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE-MULTI)):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# Make the base plot
hw <- ggplot(heightweight, aes(x=ageYear, y=heightIn, colour=sex)) +
      geom_point(aes(size=weightLb)) + scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,4))

hw

# With new legend titles
hw + labs(colour="Male/Female", size="Weight\n(pounds)")
```

![Left: two legends with original titles; right: with new
titles](figs/rgcb_1009.png)

If you have one variable mapped to two separate aesthetics, the default
is to have a single legend that combines both. For example, if we map
sex to both shape and weight, there will be just one legend
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE-MULTI-SAME), left):

```{r}
hw1 <- ggplot(heightweight, aes(x=ageYear, y=heightIn, shape=sex, colour=sex)) +
       geom_point()

hw1
```

![Left: default legend with a variable mapped to shape and colour;
middle: with shape renamed; right: with both shape and colour
renamed](figs/rgcb_1010.png)

To change the title (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE-MULTI-SAME),
right), you need to set the name for both of them. If you change the
name for just one, it will result in two separate legends
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE-MULTI-SAME), middle):

```{r}
# Change just shape
hw1 + labs(shape="Male/Female")

# Change both shape and colour
hw1 + labs(shape="Male/Female", colour="Male/Female")
```

It is also possible to control the legend title with the guides()
function. It's a little more verbose, but it can be useful when
you're already using it to control other properties:

```{r}
p + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Condition"))
```

Changing the Appearance of a Legend Title {#RECIPE_LEGEND_TITLE_APPEARANCE}
-----------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to change the appearance of a legend title's text.

### Solution

Use theme(legend.title=element\$\$\_\$\$text())
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE-APPEARANCE)):

```{r}
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()

p + theme(legend.title=element_text(face="italic", family="Times", colour="red",
                                    size=14))
```

![Customized legend title appearance](figs/rgcb_1011.png)

### Discussion

It's also possible to specify the legend title's appearance via
guides(), but this method can be a bit verbose. This has the same effect
as the previous code:

```{r}
p + guides(fill=guide_legend(title.theme=
           element_text(face="italic", family="times", colour="red", size=14)))
```

the appearance of text.

Removing a Legend Title {#RECIPE_LEGEND_TITLE_REMOVE}
-----------------------

### Problem

You want to remove a legend title.

### Solution

Add guides(fill=guide\$\$\_\$\$legend(title=NULL)) to remove the title
from a legend, as in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-TITLE-REMOVE) (for
other aesthetics, replace fill with the name of the aesthetic, such as
colour or size):

```{r}
ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot() +
    guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL))
```

![Box plot with no legend title](figs/rgcb_1012.png)

### Discussion

It is also possible to control the legend title when specifying the
scale. This has the same effect as the preceding code:

```{r}
scale_fill_hue(guide = guide_legend(title=NULL))
```

Changing the Labels in a Legend {#RECIPE_LEGEND_LABEL_TEXT}
-------------------------------

### Problem

You want to change the text of labels in a legend.

### Solution

Set the labels in the scale (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL), left):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# The base plot
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()

# Change the legend labels
p + scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"))
```

![Left: manually specified legend labels with the default discrete
scale; right: manually specified labels with a different
scale](figs/rgcb_1013.png)

### Discussion

Note that the labels on the x-axis did not change. To do that, you would
have to set the labels of scale\$\$\_\$\$x\$\$\_\$\$discrete()
([???](#RECIPE_AXES_AXIS_LABEL)), or change the data to have different
factor level names ([???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_RENAME)).

In the preceding example, group was mapped to the fill aesthetic. By
default this uses scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete(), which maps
the factor levels to colors that are equally spaced around the color
wheel (the same as scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue()). There are other
fill scales we could use, and setting the labels works the same way. For
example, to produce the graph on the right in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL):

```{r}
p + scale_fill_grey(start=.5, end=1,
                    labels=c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"))
```

If you are also changing the order of items in the legend, the labels
are matched to the items by position. In this example we'll change
the item order, and make sure to set the labels in the same order
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL-ORDER)):

```{r}
p + scale_fill_discrete(limits=c("trt1", "trt2", "ctrl"),
                        labels=c("Treatment 1", "Treatment 2", "Control"))
```

![Modified legend label order and manually specified labels (note that
the x-axis labels and their order are unchanged)](figs/rgcb_1014.png)

If you have one variable mapped to two separate aesthetics, the default
is to have a single legend that combines both. If you want to change the
legend labels, you must change them for both scales; otherwise you will
end up with two separate legends, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL-MULTI-SAME):

```{r}
# The base plot
p <- ggplot(heightweight, aes(x=ageYear, y=heightIn, shape=sex, colour=sex)) +
     geom_point()
p

# Change the labels for one scale
p + scale_shape_discrete(labels=c("Female", "Male"))

# Change the labels for both scales
p + scale_shape_discrete(labels=c("Female", "Male")) +
    scale_colour_discrete(labels=c("Female", "Male"))
```

![Left: a variable mapped to shape and colour; middle: with new labels
for shape; right: with new labels for both shape and
colour](figs/rgcb_1015.png)

Other commonly used scales with legends include:

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$grey()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$brewer()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$discrete()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$hue()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$grey()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$brewer()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$shape\$\$\_\$\$manual()

-   scale\$\$\_\$\$linetype()

By default, using scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete() is equivalent
to using scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue(); the same is true for color
scales.

Changing the Appearance of Legend Labels {#RECIPE_LEGEND_LABEL_APPEARANCE}
----------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to change the appearance of labels in a legend.

### Solution

Use theme(legend.text=element\$\$\_\$\$text())
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL-APPEARANCE)):

```{r}
# The base plot
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()

# Change the legend label appearance
p + theme(legend.text=element_text(face="italic", family="Times", colour="red",
                                   size=14))
```

![Customized legend label appearance](figs/rgcb_1016.png)

### Discussion

It's also possible to specify the legend label appearance via
guides(), although this method is a bit unwieldy. This has the same
effect as the previous code:

```{r}
# Changes the legend title text for the fill legend
p + guides(fill=guide_legend(label.theme=
           element_text(face="italic", family="Times", colour="red", size=14)))
```

the appearance of text.

Using Labels with Multiple Lines of Text {#RECIPE_LEGEND_LABEL_MULTILINE}
----------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to use legend labels that have more than one line of text.

### Solution

Set the labels in the scale, using \$\$\\\$\$n to represent a newline.
In this example, we'll use scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$discrete()
to control the legend for the fill scale
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL-MULTILINE), left):

```{r}
p <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()

# Labels that have more than one line
p + scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("Control", "Type 1\ntreatment",
                                 "Type 2\ntreatment"))
```

![Left: multiline legend labels; right: with increased key height and
reduced line spacing](figs/rgcb_1017.png)

### Discussion

As you can see in the version on the left in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL-MULTILINE), with the default settings
the lines of text will run into each other when you use labels that have
more than one line. To deal with this problem, you can increase the
height of the legend keys and decrease the spacing between lines, using
theme() (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LEGEND-LABEL-MULTILINE), right). To do
this, you will need to specify the height using the unit() function from
the grid package:

```{r}
library(grid)
p + scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("Control", "Type 1\ntreatment",
                                 "Type 2\ntreatment")) +
    theme(legend.text=element_text(lineheight=.8),
          legend.key.height=unit(1, "cm"))
```
