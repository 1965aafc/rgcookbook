Facets {#CHAPTER_FACET}
======

One of the most useful techniques in data visualization is rendering
groups of data alongside each other, making it easy to compare the
groups. With ggplot2, one way to do this is by mapping a discrete
variable to an aesthetic, like *x* position, color, or shape. Another
way of doing this is to create a subplot for each group and draw the
subplots side by side.

These kinds of plots are known as *Trellis* displays. TheyRSQUOre
implemented in the lattice package as well as in the ggplot2 package. In
ggplot2, theyRSQUOre called *facets*. In this chapter IRSQUOll explain
how to use them.

Splitting Data into Subplots with Facets {#RECIPE_FACET_BASIC}
----------------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_99}

You want to plot subsets of your data in separate panels.

### Solution {#_solution_99}

Use facet\$\$\_\$\$grid() or facet\$\$\_\$\$wrap(), and specify the
variables on which to split.

With facet\$\$\_\$\$grid(), you can specify a variable to split the data
into vertical subpanels, and another variable to split it into
horizontal subpanels ([figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_FACET_GRID)):

```{r}
# The base plot
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point()

# Faceted by drv, in vertically arranged subpanels
p + facet_grid(drv ~ .)

# Faceted by cyl, in horizontally arranged subpanels
p + facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

# Split by drv (vertical) and cyl (horizontal)
p + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

![Top: faceting horizontally by drv; bottom left: faceting vertically by
cyl; bottom right: faceting in both directions, with both
variables](figs/rgcb_1101.png)

With facet\$\$\_\$\$wrap(), the subplots are laid out horizontally and
wrap around, like words on a page, as in
[figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_FACET_WRAP):

```{r}
# Facet on class
# Note there is nothing before the tilde
p + facet_wrap( ~ class)
```

![A scatter plot with facet\_wrap() on class](figs/rgcb_1102.png)

### Discussion {#_discussion_92}

With facet\$\$\_\$\$wrap(), the default is to use the same number of
rows and columns. In [figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_FACET_WRAP), there were
seven facets, and they fit into a 3 ×3 LDQUOsquare.RDQUO To change this,
you can pass a value for nrow or ncol:

```{r}
# These will have the same result: 2 rows and 4 cols
p + facet_wrap( ~ class, nrow=2)
p + facet_wrap( ~ class, ncol=4)
```

The choice of faceting direction depends on the kind of comparison you
would like to encourage. For example, if you want to compare heights of
bars, itRSQUOs useful to make the facets go horizontally. If, on the
other hand, you want to compare the horizontal distribution of
histograms, it makes sense to make the facets go vertically.

Sometimes both kinds of comparisons are important—there may not be a
clear answer as to which faceting direction is best. It may turn out
that displaying the groups in a single plot by mapping the grouping
variable to an aesthetic like color works better than using facets. In
these situations, youRSQUOll have to rely on your judgment.

Using Facets with Different Axes {#RECIPE_FACET_FREE}
--------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_100}

You want subplots with different ranges or items on their axes.

### Solution {#_solution_100}

Set the scales to "free\$\$\_\$\$x", "free\$\$\_\$\$y", or "free"
([figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_FACET_FREE)):

```{r}
# The base plot
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point()

# With free y scales
p + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales="free_y")

# With free x and y scales
p + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales="free")
```

![Top: with free y scales; bottom: with free x and y
scales](figs/rgcb_1103.png)

### Discussion {#_discussion_93}

Each row of subplots has its own *y* range when free *y* scales are
used; the same applies to columns when free *x* scales are used.

ItRSQUOs not possible to directly set the range of each row or column,
but you can control the ranges by dropping unwanted data (to reduce the
ranges), or by adding geom\$\$\_\$\$blank() (to expand the ranges).

### See Also {#_see_also_64}

See [???](#RECIPE_BAR_GRAPH_DOT_PLOT) for an example of faceting with
free scales and a discrete axis.

Changing the Text of Facet Labels {#RECIPE_FACET_LABEL_TEXT}
---------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_101}

You want to change the text of facet labels.

### Solution {#_solution_101}

Change the names of the factor levels
([figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_LABEL_TEXT)):

```{r}
mpg2 <- mpg  # Make a copy of the original data

# Rename 4 to 4wd, f to Front, r to Rear
levels(mpg2$drv)[levels(mpg2$drv)=="4"]  <- "4wd"
levels(mpg2$drv)[levels(mpg2$drv)=="f"]  <- "Front"
levels(mpg2$drv)[levels(mpg2$drv)=="r"]  <- "Rear"

# Plot the new data
ggplot(mpg2, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(drv ~ .)
```

![Left: default facet labels; right: modified facet
labels](figs/rgcb_1104.png)

### Discussion {#_discussion_94}

Unlike with scales where you can set the labels, to set facet labels you
must change the data values. Also, at the time of this writing, there is
no way to show the name of the faceting variable as a header for the
facets, so it can be useful to use descriptive facet labels.

With facet\$\$\_\$\$grid() but not facet\$\$\_\$\$wrap(), at this time),
itRSQUOs possible to use a labeller function to set the labels. The
labeller function label\$\$\_\$\$both() will print out both the name of
the variable and the value of the variable in each facet
([figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_LABEL_TEXT_LABELLER), left):

```{r}
ggplot(mpg2, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point() +
    facet_grid(drv ~ ., labeller = label_both)
```

Another useful labeller is label\$\$\_\$\$parsed(), which takes strings
and treats them as R math expressions
([figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_LABEL_TEXT_LABELLER), right):

```{r}
mpg3 <- mpg

levels(mpg3$drv)[levels(mpg3$drv)=="4"]  <- "4^{wd}"
levels(mpg3$drv)[levels(mpg3$drv)=="f"]  <- "- Front %.% e^{pi * i}"
levels(mpg3$drv)[levels(mpg3$drv)=="r"]  <- "4^{wd} - Front"

ggplot(mpg3, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point() +
    facet_grid(drv ~ ., labeller = label_parsed)
```

![Left: with label\_both(); right: with label\_parsed() for mathematical
expressions](figs/rgcb_1105.png)

### See Also {#_see_also_65}

See [???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_FACTOR_RENAME) for more on renaming factor
levels. If the faceting variable is not a factor but a character vector,
changing the values is somewhat different. See
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_CHARACTER_RENAME) for information on renaming
items in character vectors.

Changing the Appearance of Facet Labels and Headers {#RECIPE_FACET_LABEL_APPEARANCE}
---------------------------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_102}

You want to change the appearance of facet labels and headers.

### Solution {#_solution_102}

With the theming system, set strip.text to control the text appearance
and strip.background to control the background appearance
([figure\_title](#FIG_FACET_LABEL_APPEARANCE)):

```{r}
library(gcookbook)  # For the data set

ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Cultivar, y=Weight)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    facet_grid(. ~ Date) +
    theme(strip.text = element_text(face="bold", size=rel(1.5)),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill="lightblue", colour="black",
                                          size=1))
```

![Customized appearance for facet labels](figs/rgcb_1106.png)

### Discussion {#_discussion}

Using rel(1.5) makes the label text 1.5 times the size of the base text
size for the theme. Using size=1 for the background makes the outline of
the facets 1 mm thick.
