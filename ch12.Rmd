Using Colors in Plots {#CHAPTER_COLORS}
=====================

In ggplot2's implementation of the grammar of graphics, color is an
aesthetic, just like *x* position, *y* position, and size. If color is
just another aesthetic, why does it deserve its own chapter? The reason
is that color is a more complicated aesthetic than the others. Instead
of simply moving geoms left and right or making them larger and smaller,
when you use color, there are many degrees of freedom and many more
choices to make. What palette should you use for discrete values? Should
you use a gradient with several different hues? How do you choose colors
that can be interpreted accurately by those with color-vision
deficiencies? In this chapter, I'll address these issues.

Setting the Colors of Objects {#RECIPE_COLORS_SETTING}
-----------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_103}

You want to set the color of some geoms in your graph.

### Solution {#_solution_103}

In the call to the geom, set the values of colour or fill
([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_SETTING)):

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point(colour="red")

library(MASS) # For the data set
ggplot(birthwt, aes(x=bwt)) + geom_histogram(fill="red", colour="black")
```

![Left: setting fill and colour; right: setting colour for
points](figs/rgcb_1201.png)

### Discussion {#_discussion_95}

In ggplot2, there's an important difference between *setting* and
*mapping* aesthetic properties. In the preceding example, we set the
color of the objects to "red".

Generally speaking, colour controls the color of lines and of the
outlines of polygons, while fill controls the color of the fill area of
polygons. However, point shapes are sometimes a little different. For
most point shapes, the color of the entire point is controlled by
colour, not fill. The exception is the point shapes (21–25) that have
both a fill and an outline.

### See Also {#_see_also_67}

For more information about point shapes, see
[???](#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_POINT_APPEARANCE).

See [section\_title](#RECIPE_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE_MANUAL) for more on
specifying colors.

Mapping Variables to Colors {#RECIPE_COLORS_MAPPING}
---------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_104}

You want to use a variable (column from a data frame) to control the
color of geoms.

### Solution {#_solution_104}

In the call to the geom, set the value of colour or fill to the name of
one of the columns in the data ([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_MAPPING)):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# These both have the same effect
ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight, fill=Cultivar)) +
    geom_bar(colour="black", position="dodge")

ggplot(cabbage_exp, aes(x=Date, y=Weight)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=Cultivar), colour="black", position="dodge")

# These both have the same effect
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, colour=cyl)) + geom_point()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point(aes(colour=cyl))
```

![Left: mapping a variable to fill; right: mapping a variable to colour
for points](figs/rgcb_1202.png)

When the mapping is specified in ggplot() it sets the default mapping,
which is inherited by all the geoms. The default mappings can be
overridden by specifying mappings within a geom.

### Discussion {#_discussion_96}

In the cabbage\$\$\_\$\$exp example, the variable Cultivar is mapped to
fill. The Cultivar column in cabbage\$\$\_\$\$exp is a factor, so
ggplot2 treats it as a discrete variable. You can check the type using
str():

str(cabbage\_exp)
'data.frame': 6 obs. of 6 variables: \$ Cultivar: Factor w/ 2 levels
"c39","c52": 1 1 1 2 2 2 \$ Date : Factor w/ 3 levels "d16","d20","d21":
1 2 3 1 2 3 \$ Weight : num 3.18 2.8 2.74 2.26 3.11 1.47 \$ sd : num
0.957 0.279 0.983 0.445 0.791 ... \$ n : int 10 10 10 10 10 10 \$ se :
num 0.3025 0.0882 0.311 0.1408 0.2501 ...
In the mtcars example, cyl is numeric, so it is treated as a continuous
variable. Because of this, even though the actual values of cyl include
only 4, 6, and 8, the legend has entries for the intermediate values 5
and 7. To make ggplot() treat cyl as a categorical variable, you can
convert it to a factor in the call to ggplot(), or you can modify the
data so that the column is a character vector or factor
([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_MAPPING_FACTOR)):

```{r}
# Convert to factor in call to ggplot()
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, colour=factor(cyl))) + geom_point()

# Another method: Convert to factor in the data
m <- mtcars              # Make a copy of mtcars
m$cyl <- factor(m$cyl)   # Convert cyl to a factor
ggplot(m, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, colour=cyl)) + geom_point()
```

factor](figs/rgcb_1203.png)

Using a Different Palette for a Discrete Variable {#RECIPE_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE}
-------------------------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_105}

You want to use different colors for a discrete mapped variable.

### Solution {#_solution_105}

Use one of the scales listed in
[table\_title](#Table_12-1_discrete_fill_and_color_scales).

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Fill scale           | Color scale          | Description           |

: Discrete fill and color scales

In the example here we'll use the default palette (hue), and a
ColorBrewer palette ([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE)):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# Base plot
p <- ggplot(uspopage, aes(x=Year, y=Thousands, fill=AgeGroup)) + geom_area()

# These three have the same effect
p
p + scale_fill_discrete()
p + scale_fill_hue()

# ColorBrewer palette
p + scale_fill_brewer()
```

![Left: default palette (using hue); right: a ColorBrewer
palette](figs/rgcb_1204.png)

### Discussion {#_discussion_97}

Changing a palette is a modification of the color (or fill) scale: it
involves a change in the mapping from numeric or categorical values to
aesthetic attributes. There are two types of scales that use colors:
*fill* scales and *color* scales.

With scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$hue(), the colors are taken from
around the color wheel in the HCL (hue-chroma-lightness) color space.
The default lightness value is 65 on a scale from 0–100. This is good
for filled areas, but it's a bit light for points and lines. To make
the colors darker for points and lines, as in
[figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_LIGHTNESS) (right), set the value of
l (luminance/lightness):

```{r}
# Basic scatter plot
h <- ggplot(heightweight, aes(x=ageYear, y=heightIn, colour=sex)) +
    geom_point()

# Default lightness = 65
h

# Slightly darker
h + scale_colour_hue(l=45)
```

![Left: points with default lightness; right: with lightness set to
45](figs/rgcb_1205.png)

The ColorBrewer package provides a number of palettes. You can generate
a graphic showing all of them, as shown in
[figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_BREWER):

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all()
```

![All the ColorBrewer palettes](figs/rgcb_1206.png)

The ColorBrewer palettes can be selected by name. For example, this will
use the Oranges palette
([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_BREWER_NAME)):

```{r}
p + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Oranges")
```

![Using a named ColorBrewer palette](figs/rgcb_1207.png)

You can also use a palette of greys. This is useful for print when the
output is in black and white. The default is to start at 0.2 and end at
0.8, on a scale from 0 (black) to 1 (white), but you can change the
range, as shown in [figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_GREY).

```{r}
p + scale_fill_grey()

# Reverse the direction and use a different range of greys
p + scale_fill_grey(start=0.7, end=0)
```

![Left: using the default grey palette; right: a different grey
palette](figs/rgcb_1208.png)

Using a Manually Defined Palette for a Discrete Variable {#RECIPE_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE_MANUAL}
--------------------------------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_106}

You want to use different colors for a discrete mapped variable.

### Solution {#_solution_106}

In the example here, we'll manually define colors by specifying
values with scale\$\$\_\$\$colour\$\$\_\$\$manual()
([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE_MANUAL)). The colors can
be named, or they can be specified with RGB values:

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# Base plot
h <- ggplot(heightweight, aes(x=ageYear, y=heightIn, colour=sex)) + geom_point()

# Using color names
h + scale_colour_manual(values=c("red", "blue"))

# Using RGB values
h + scale_colour_manual(values=c("#CC6666", "#7777DD"))
```

![Left: scatter plot with named colors; right: with slightly different
RGB colors](figs/rgcb_1209.png)

For fill scales, use scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$manual() instead.

### Discussion {#_discussion_98}

The order of the items in the values vector matches the order of the
factor levels for the discrete scale. In the preceding example, the
order of sex is f, then m, so the first item in values goes with f and
the second goes with m. Here's how to see the order of factor
levels:

levels(heightweight\$sex)
"f" "m"
If the variable is a character vector, not a factor, it will
automatically be converted to a factor, and by default the levels will
appear in alphabetical order.

It's possible to specify the colors in a different order by using a
named vector:

```{r}
h + scale_colour_manual(values=c(m="blue", f="red"))
```

There is a large set of named colors in R, which you can see by running
color(). Some basic color names are useful: "white", "black", "grey80",
"red", "blue", "darkred", and so on. There are many other named colors,
but their names are generally not very informative (I certainly have no
idea what "thistle3" and "seashell" look like), so it's often easier
to use numeric RGB values for specifying colors.

RGB colors are specified as six-digit hexadecimal (base-16) numbers of
the form "\#RRGGBB". In hexadecimal, the digits go from 0 to 9, and then
continue with A (10 in base 10) to F (15 in base 10). Each color is
represented by two digits and can range from 00 to FF (255 in base 10).
So, for example, the color "\#FF0099" has a value of 255 for red, 0 for
green, and 153 for blue, resulting in a shade of magenta. The
hexadecimal numbers for each color channel often repeat the same digit
because it makes them a little easier to read, and because the precise
value of the second digit has a relatively insignificant effect on
appearance.

Here are some rules of thumb for specifying and adjusting RGB colors:

-   In general, higher numbers are brighter and lower numbers are
    darker.

-   To get a shade of grey, set all the channels to the same value.

-   The opposites of RGB are CMY: Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow. Higher
    values for the red channel make it more red, and lower values make
    it more cyan. The same is true for the pairs green and magenta, and
    blue and yellow.

Using a Colorblind-Friendly Palette {#RECIPE_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE_COLORBLIND}
-----------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_107}

You want to use colors that can be distinguished by colorblind viewers.

### Solution {#_solution_107}

Use the palette defined here (cb\$\$\_\$\$palette)with
scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$manual()
([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE_COLORBLIND)):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# Base plot
p <- ggplot(uspopage, aes(x=Year, y=Thousands, fill=AgeGroup)) + geom_area()

# The palette with grey:
cb_palette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442",
                "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

# Add it to the plot
p + scale_fill_manual(values=cb_palette)
```

![A graph with the colorblind-friendly palette](figs/rgcb_1210.png)

A chart of the colors is shown in
[figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_DISCRETE_COLORBLIND_CHART).

![Colorblind palette with RGB values](figs/rgcb_1211.png)

In some cases it may be better to use black instead of grey. To do this,
replace the "\#999999" with "\#000000" or "black":

```{r}
c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00",
  "#CC79A7")
```

### Discussion {#_discussion_99}

About 8 percent of males and 0.5 percent of females have some form of
color-vision deficiency, so there's a good chance that someone in
your audience will be among them.

There are many different forms of color blindness. The palette here is
designed to enable people with any of the most common forms of
color-vision deficiency to distinguish the colors. (Monochromacy, or
total colorblindness, is rare. Those who have it can only see
differences in brightness.)

### See Also {#_see_also_71}

The [source of this palette](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/).

The [Color Oracle program](http://colororacle.org) can simulate how
things on your screen appear to someone with color vision deficiency,
but keep in mind that the simulation isn't perfect. In my informal
testing, I viewed an image with simulated red-green deficiency, and I
could distinguish the colors just fine—but others with actual red-green
deficiency viewed the same image and couldn't tell the colors apart!

Using a Manually Defined Palette for a Continuous Variable {#RECIPE_COLORS_PALETTE_CONTINUOUS}
----------------------------------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_108}

You want to use different colors for a continuous variable.

### Solution {#_solution_108}

In the example here, we'll specify the colors for a continuous
variable using various gradient scales
([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_PALETTE_CONTINUOUS)). The colors can be
named, or they can be specified with RGB values:

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

# Base plot
p <- ggplot(heightweight, aes(x=ageYear, y=heightIn, colour=weightLb)) +
     geom_point(size=3)

p

# With a gradient between two colors
p + scale_colour_gradient(low="black", high="white")

# A gradient with a white midpoint
library(scales)
p + scale_colour_gradient2(low=muted("red"), mid="white", high=muted("blue"),
    midpoint=110)

# A gradient of n colors
p + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = c("darkred", "orange", "yellow", "white"))
```

![Clockwise from top left: default colors, two-color gradient with
scale\_colour\_gradient(), three-color gradient with midpoint with
scale\_colour\_gradient2(), four-color gradient with
scale\_colour\_gradientn()](figs/rgcb_1212.png)

For fill scales, use scale\$\$\_\$\$fill\$\$\_\$\$xxx() versions
instead, where xxx is one of gradient, gradient2, or gradientn.

### Discussion {#_discussion_100}

Mapping continuous values to a color scale requires a continuously
changing palette of colors.
[table\_title](#table_12-2_types_of_continuous_color_scales) lists the
continuous color and fill scales.

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Fill scale           | Color scale          | Description           |

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

: Continuous fill and color scales

Notice that we used the muted() function in the examples. This is a
function from the scales package that returns an RGB value that is a
less-saturated version of the color chosen.

### See Also {#_see_also_72}

If you want use a discrete (categorical) scale instead of a continuous
one, you can recode your data into categorical values. See
[???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_RECODE_CONTINUOUS).

Coloring a Shaded Region Based on Value {#RECIPE_COLORS_AREA_VALUE}
---------------------------------------

### Problem {#_problem_109}

You want to set the color of a shaded region based on the *y* value.

### Solution {#_solution_109}

Add a column that categorizes the *y* values, then map that column to
fill. In this example, we’ll first categorize the values as positive or
negative:

library(gcookbook) \# For the data set cb &lt;- subset(climate,
Source=="Berkeley") cb\$valence\[cb\$Anomaly10y &gt;= 0\] &lt;- "pos"
cb\$valence\[cb\$Anomaly10y &lt; 0\] &lt;- "neg" cb
Source Year Anomaly1y Anomaly5y Anomaly10y Unc10y valence Berkeley 1800
NA NA -0.435 0.505 neg Berkeley 1801 NA NA -0.453 0.493 neg Berkeley
1802 NA NA -0.460 0.486 neg ... Berkeley 2002 NA NA 0.856 0.028 pos
Berkeley 2003 NA NA 0.869 0.028 pos Berkeley 2004 NA NA 0.884 0.029 pos
Once we've categorized the values as positive or negative, we can
make the plot, mapping valence to the fill color, as shown in
[figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_AREA_VALUE):

```{r}
ggplot(cb, aes(x=Year, y=Anomaly10y)) +
    geom_area(aes(fill=valence)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0)
```

![Mapping valence to fill color—notice the red area under the zero line
around 1950](figs/rgcb_1213.png)

### Discussion {#_discussion_101}

If you look closely at the figure, you'll notice that there are some
stray shaded areas near the zero line. This is because each of the two
colored areas is a single polygon bounded by the data points, and the
data points are not actually at zero. To solve this problem, we can
interpolate the data to 1,000 points by using approx():

```{r}
# approx() returns a list with x and y vectors
interp <- approx(cb$Year, cb$Anomaly10y, n=1000)

# Put in a data frame and recalculate valence
cbi <- data.frame(Year=interp$x, Anomaly10y=interp$y)
cbi$valence[cbi$Anomaly10y >= 0] <- "pos"
cbi$valence[cbi$Anomaly10y < 0]  <- "neg"
```

It would be more precise (and more complicated) to interpolate exactly
where the line crosses zero, but approx() works fine for the purposes
here.

Now we can plot the interpolated data
([figure\_title](#FIG_COLORS_AREA_VALUE_INTERPOLATED)). This time
we'll make a few adjustments—we'll make the shaded regions
partially transparent, change the colors, remove the legend, and remove
the padding on the left and right sides:

```{r}
ggplot(cbi, aes(x=Year, y=Anomaly10y)) +
    geom_area(aes(fill=valence), alpha = .4) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#CCEEFF", "#FFDDDD"), guide=FALSE) +
    scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0, 0))
```

![Shaded regions with interpolated data](figs/rgcb_1214.png)
