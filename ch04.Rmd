Line Graphs {#CHAPTER_LINE_GRAPH}
===========

Line graphs are typically used for visualizing how one continuous
variable, on the y-axis, changes in relation to another continuous
variable, on the x-axis. Often the *x* variable represents time, but it
may also represent some other continuous quantity, like the amount of a
drug administered to experimental subjects.

As with bar graphs, there are exceptions. Line graphs can also be used
with a discrete variable on the x-axis. This is appropriate when the
variable is ordered (e.g., "small", "medium",
"large"), but not when the variable is unordered (e.g.,
"cow", "goose", "pig"). Most of the examples in
this chapter use a continuous *x* variable, but we'll see one
example where the variable is converted to a factor and thus treated as
a discrete variable.

Making a Basic Line Graph {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_BASIC_LINE}
-------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a basic line graph.

### Solution

Use ggplot() with geom_line(), and specify what variables you
mapped to x and y (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE)):

```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line()
```

![Basic line graph](figs/rgcb_0401.png)

### Discussion

In this sample data set, the *x* variable, Time, is in one column and
the *y* variable, demand, is in another:

BOD
Time demand 1 8.3 2 10.3 3 19.0 4 16.0 5 15.6 7 19.8
Line graphs can be made with discrete (categorical) or continuous
(numeric) variables on the x-axis. In the example here, the variable
demand is numeric, but it could be treated as a categorical variable by
converting it to a factorwith factor()
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-FACTOR)). When the *x*
variable is a factor, you must also use aes(group=1) to ensure that
ggplot() knows that the data points belong together and should be
connected with a line (see
[section\_title](#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_MULTIPLE_LINE) for an explanation of
why group is needed with factors):

```{r}
BOD1 <- BOD # Make a copy of the data
BOD1$Time <- factor(BOD1$Time)
ggplot(BOD1, aes(x=Time, y=demand, group=1)) + geom_line()
```

![Basic line graph with a factor on the x-axis (notice that no space is
allocated on the x-axis for 6)](figs/rgcb_0402.png)

In the BOD data set there is no entry for Time=6, so there is no level 6
when Time is converted to a factor. Factors hold categorical values, and
in that context, 6 is just another value. It happens to not be in the
data set, so there's no space for it on the x-axis.

With ggplot2, the default *y* range of a line graph is just enough to
include the *y* values in the data. For some kinds of data, it's
better to have the *y* range start from zero. You can use ylim() to set
the range, or you can use expand_limits() to expand the range
to include a value. This will set the range from zero to the maximum
value of the demand column in BOD
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-YLIM)):

```{r}
# These have the same result
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line() + ylim(0, max(BOD$demand))
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line() + expand_limits(y=0)
```

![Line graph with manually set y range](figs/rgcb_0403.png)

axes.

Adding Points to a Line Graph {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_POINTS}
-----------------------------

### Problem

You want to add points to a line graph.

### Solution

Add geom_point() (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-POINT)):

```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

![Line graph with points](figs/rgcb_0404.png)

### Discussion

Sometimes it is useful to indicate each data point on a line graph. This
is helpful when the density of observations is low, or when the
observations do not happen at regular intervals. For example, in the BOD
data set there is no entry for Time=6, but this is not apparent from
just a bare line graph (compare
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-YLIM) with
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-POINT)).

In the worldpop data set, the intervals between each data point are not
consistent. In the far past, the estimates were not as frequent as they
are in the more recent past. Displaying points on the graph illustrates
when each estimate was made
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-POINTS-INTERVAL)):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

ggplot(worldpop, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

# Same with a log y-axis
ggplot(worldpop, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
    scale_y_log10()
```

![Top: points indicate where each data point is; bottom: the same data
with a log y-axis](figs/rgcb_0405.png)

With the log y-axis, you can see that the rate of proportional change
has increased in the last thousand years. The estimates for the years
before 0 have a roughly constant rate of change of 10 times per 5,000
years. In the most recent 1,000 years, the population has increased at a
much faster rate. We can also see that the population estimates are much
more frequent in recent timesâ€”and probably more accurate!

[section\_title](#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_POINT_APPEARANCE).

Making a Line Graph with Multiple Lines {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_MULTIPLE_LINE}
---------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a line graph with more than one line.

### Solution

In addition to the variables mapped to the x- and y-axes, map another
(discrete) variable to colour or linetype, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-COLOR-TYPE):

```{r}
# Load plyr so we can use ddply() to create the example data set
library(plyr)
# Summarize the ToothGrowth data
tg <- ddply(ToothGrowth, c("supp", "dose"), summarise, length=mean(len))

# Map supp to colour
ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, colour=supp)) + geom_line()

# Map supp to linetype
ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, linetype=supp)) + geom_line()
```

![Left: a variable mapped to colour; right: a variable mapped to
linetype](figs/rgcb_0406.png)

### Discussion

The tg data has three columns, including the factor supp, which we
mapped to colour and linetype:

tg
supp dose length OJ 0.5 13.23 OJ 1.0 22.70 OJ 2.0 26.06 VC 0.5 7.98 VC
1.0 16.77 VC 2.0 26.14
str(tg)
'data.frame': 6 obs. of 3 variables: \$ supp : Factor w/ 2 levels
"OJ","VC": 1 1 1 2 2 2 \$ dose : num 0.5 1 2 0.5 1 2 \$ length: num
13.23 22.7 26.06 7.98 16.77 ...
> **Note**
>
> If the *x* variable is a factor, you must also tell ggplot() to group
> by that same variable, as described momentarily.

Line graphs can be used with a continuous or categorical variable on the
x-axis. Sometimes the variable mapped to the x-axis is *conceived* of as
being categorical, even when it's stored as a number. In the example
here, there are three values of dose: 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. You may want to
treat these as categories rather than values on a continuous scale. To
do this, convert dose to a factor
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-FACTOR)):

```{r}
ggplot(tg, aes(x=factor(dose), y=length, colour=supp, group=supp)) + geom_line()
```

![Line graph with continuous x variable converted to a
factor](figs/rgcb_0407.png)

Notice the use of group=supp. Without this statement, ggplot() won't
know how to group the data together to draw the lines, and it will give
an error:

ggplot(tg, aes(x=factor(dose), y=length, colour=supp)) + geom\_line()
geom\_path: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to
adjust the group aesthetic?
Another common problem when the incorrect grouping is used is that you
will see a jagged sawtooth pattern, as in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-SAWTOOTH):

```{r}
ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length)) + geom_line()
```

![A sawtooth pattern indicates improper grouping](figs/rgcb_0408.png)

This happens because there are multiple data points at each *y*
location, and ggplot() thinks they're all in one group. The data
points for each group are connected with a single line, leading to the
sawtooth pattern. If any *discrete* variables are mapped to aesthetics
like colour or linetype, they are automatically used as grouping
variables. But if you want to use other variables for grouping (that
aren't mapped to an aesthetic), they should be used with group.

> **Note**
>
> When in doubt, if your line graph looks wrong, try explicitly
> specifying the grouping variable with group. It's common for
> problems to occur with line graphs because ggplot() is unsure of how
> the variables should be grouped.

If your plot has points along with the lines, you can also map variables
to properties of the points, such as shape and fill
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-SHAPE-FILL)):

```{r}
ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, shape=supp)) + geom_line() +
    geom_point(size=4)           # Make the points a little larger

ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, fill=supp)) + geom_line() +
    geom_point(size=4, shape=21) # Also use a point with a color fill
```

![Left: line graph with different shapes; right: with different
colors](figs/rgcb_0409.png)

Sometimes points will overlap. In these cases, you may want to *dodge*
them, which means their positions will be adjusted left and right
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-DODGE)). When doing so, you
must also dodge the lines, or else only the points will move and they
will be misaligned. You must also specify how far they should move
whendodged:

```{r}
ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, shape=supp)) +
    geom_line(position=position_dodge(0.2)) +         # Dodge lines by 0.2
    geom_point(position=position_dodge(0.2), size=4)  # Dodge points by 0.2
```

![Dodging to avoid overlapping points](figs/rgcb_0410.png)

Changing the Appearance of Lines {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_LINE_APPEARANCE}
--------------------------------

### Problem

You want to change the appearance of the lines in a line graph.

### Solution

The type of line (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) is set with linetype, the
thickness (in mm) with size, and the color of the line with colour.

These properties can be set (as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-BAR-GRAPH-BASIC-LINE-CUSTOMIZED)) by passing them
values in the call to geom_line():

```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) +
    geom_line(linetype="dashed", size=1, colour="blue")
```

![Line graph with custom linetype, size, and colour](figs/rgcb_0411.png)

If there is more than one line, setting the aesthetic properties will
affect all of the lines. On the other hand, *mapping* variables to the
properties, as we saw in
[section\_title](#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_MULTIPLE_LINE), will result in each
line looking different. The default colors aren't the most
appealing, so you may want to use a different palette, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-PALETTE), by using
scale_colour\$\$\_\$\$brewer() or
scale_colour\$\$\_\$\$manual():

```{r}
# Load plyr so we can use ddply() to create the example data set
library(plyr)
# Summarize the ToothGrowth data
tg <- ddply(ToothGrowth, c("supp", "dose"), summarise, length=mean(len))

ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, colour=supp)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_colour_brewer(palette="Set1")
```

![Using a palette from RColorBrewer](figs/rgcb_0412.png)

### Discussion

To set a single constant color for all the lines, specify colour outside
of aes(). The same works for size, linetype, and point shape
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-CONSTANT-AES)). You may also
have to specify the grouping variable:

```{r}
# If both lines have the same properties, you need to specify a variable to
# use for grouping
ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, group=supp)) +
    geom_line(colour="darkgreen", size=1.5)

# Since supp is mapped to colour, it will automatically be used for grouping
ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, colour=supp)) +
    geom_line(linetype="dashed") +
    geom_point(shape=22, size=3, fill="white")
```

![Left: line graph with constant size and color; right: with supp mapped
to colour, and with points added](figs/rgcb_0413.png)

Changing the Appearance of Points {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_POINT_APPEARANCE}
---------------------------------

### Problem

You want to change the appearance of the points in a line graph.

### Solution

In geom_point(), setthe size, shape, colour, and/or fill
outside of aes() (the result is shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-POINT-PROPERTIES)):

```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(size=4, shape=22, colour="darkred", fill="pink")
```

![Points with custom size, shape, color, and fill](figs/rgcb_0414.png)

### Discussion

The default shape for points is a solid circle, the default size is 2,
and the default colour is "black". The fill color is relevant only for
some point shapes (numbered 21â€“25), which have separate outline and fill
colors (see [???](#RECIPE_SCATTER_SHAPES) for a chart of shapes). The
fill color is typically NA, or empty; you can fill it with white to get
hollow-looking circles, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-POINT-WHITEFILL):

```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x=Time, y=demand)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(size=4, shape=21, fill="white")
```

![Points with a white fill](figs/rgcb_0415.png)

If the points and lines have different colors, you should specify the
points after the lines, so that they are drawn on top. Otherwise, the
lines will be drawn on top of the points.

For multiple lines, we saw in
[section\_title](#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_MULTIPLE_LINE) how to draw
differently colored points for each group by mapping variables to
aesthetic properties of points, inside of aes(). The default colors are
not very appealing, so you may want to use a different palette, using
scale_colour\$\$\_\$\$brewer() or
scale_colour\$\$\_\$\$manual(). To set a single constant shape
or size for all the points, as in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-MULTI-LINE-POINT-PALETTE), specify shape
or size outside of aes():

```{r}
# Load plyr so we can use ddply() to create the example data set
library(plyr)
# Summarize the ToothGrowth data
tg <- ddply(ToothGrowth, c("supp", "dose"), summarise, length=mean(len))

# Save the position_dodge specification because we'll use it multiple times
pd <- position_dodge(0.2)

ggplot(tg, aes(x=dose, y=length, fill=supp)) +
    geom_line(position=pd) +
    geom_point(shape=21, size=3, position=pd) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("black","white"))
```

![Line graph with manually specified fills of black and white, and a
slight dodge](figs/rgcb_0416.png)

Making a Graph with a Shaded Area {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_AREA}
---------------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a graph with a shaded area.

### Solution

Use geom_area() toget a shaded area, as in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-AREA):

```{r}
# Convert the sunspot.year data set into a data frame for this example
sunspotyear <- data.frame(
    Year     = as.numeric(time(sunspot.year)),
    Sunspots = as.numeric(sunspot.year)
)

ggplot(sunspotyear, aes(x=Year, y=Sunspots)) + geom_area()
```

![Graph with a shaded area](figs/rgcb_0417.png)

### Discussion

By default, the area will be filled with a very dark grey and will have
no outline. The color can be changed by setting fill. In the following
example, we'll set it to "blue", and we'll also make it 80%
transparent by setting alpha to 0.2. This makes it possible to see the
grid lines through the area, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-AREA-OUTLINE). We'll also add an
outline, by setting colour:

```{r}
ggplot(sunspotyear, aes(x=Year, y=Sunspots)) +
    geom_area(colour="black", fill="blue", alpha=.2)
```

![Graph with a semitransparent shaded area and an
outline](figs/rgcb_0418.png)

Having an outline around the entire area might not be desirable, because
it puts a vertical line at the beginning and end of the shaded area, as
well as one along the bottom. To avoid this issue, we can draw the area
without an outline (by not specifying colour), and then layer a
geom_line() on top, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-AREA-TOPLINE):

```{r}
ggplot(sunspotyear, aes(x=Year, y=Sunspots)) +
    geom_area(fill="blue", alpha=.2) +
    geom_line()
```

![Line graph with a line just on top, using
geom\_line()](figs/rgcb_0419.png)

### See Also

See [???](#CHAPTER_COLORS) for more on choosing colors.

Making a Stacked Area Graph {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_STACKED_AREA}
---------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a stacked area graph.

### Solution

Use geom_area() andmap a factor to fill
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-STACKED-AREA)):

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set

ggplot(uspopage, aes(x=Year, y=Thousands, fill=AgeGroup)) + geom_area()
```

![Stacked area graph](figs/rgcb_0420.png)

### Discussion

The sort of data that is plotted with a stacked area chart is often
provided in a wide format, but ggplot2() requires data to be in long
format. To convert it, see [???](#RECIPE_DATAPREP_WIDE_TO_LONG).

In the example here, we used the uspopage data set:

uspopage
Year AgeGroup Thousands 1900 &lt;5 9181 1900 5-14 16966 1900 15-24 14951
1900 25-34 12161 1900 35-44 9273 1900 45-54 6437 1900 55-64 4026 1900
&gt;64 3099 1901 &lt;5 9336 1901 5-14 17158 ...
The default order of legend items is the opposite of the stacking order.
The legend can be reversed by setting the breaks in the scale. This
version of the chart
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-STACKED-AREA-CUSTOMIZED)) reverses the
legend order, changes the palette to a range of blues, and adds thin
(size=.2) lines between each area. It also makes the filled areas
semitransparent (alpha=.4), so that it is possible to see the grid lines
through them:

```{r}
ggplot(uspopage, aes(x=Year, y=Thousands, fill=AgeGroup)) +
    geom_area(colour="black", size=.2, alpha=.4) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues", breaks=rev(levels(uspopage$AgeGroup)))
```

![Reversed legend order, lines, and a different
palette](figs/rgcb_0421.png)

To reverse the stacking order, we'll put order=desc(AgeGroup) inside
of aes() (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-STACKED-AREA-REVSTACK)):

```{r}
library(plyr) # For the desc() function
ggplot(uspopage, aes(x=Year, y=Thousands, fill=AgeGroup, order=desc(AgeGroup))) +
    geom_area(colour="black", size=.2, alpha=.4) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues")
```

![Reversed stacking order](figs/rgcb_0422.png)

Since each filled area is drawn with a polygon, the outline includes the
left and right sides. This might be distracting or misleading. To get
rid of it (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-STACKED-AREA-NOSIDES)), first
draw the stacked areas *without* an outline (by leaving colour as the
default NA value), and then add a geom_line() on top:

```{r}
ggplot(uspopage, aes(x=Year, y=Thousands, fill=AgeGroup, order=desc(AgeGroup))) +
    geom_area(colour=NA, alpha=.4) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") +
    geom_line(position="stack", size=.2)
```

![No lines on the left and right of the graph](figs/rgcb_0423.png)

Making a Proportional Stacked Area Graph {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_PROPORTIONAL_STACKED_AREA}
----------------------------------------

### Problem

You want to make a stacked area graph with the overall height scaled to
a constant value.

### Solution

First, calculate the proportions. In this example, we'll useddply()
to break uspopage into groups by Year, then calculate a new column,
Percent. This value is the Thousands for each row, divided by the sum of
Thousands for each Year group, multiplied by 100 to get a percent value:

```{r}
library(gcookbook) # For the data set
library(plyr)      # For the ddply() function

# Convert Thousands to Percent
uspopage_prop <- ddply(uspopage, "Year", transform,
                       Percent = Thousands / sum(Thousands) * 100)
```

Once we've calculated the proportions, plotting is the same as with
a regular stacked area graph
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-PROPORTIONAL-STACKED-AREA)):

```{r}
ggplot(uspopage_prop, aes(x=Year, y=Percent, fill=AgeGroup)) +
    geom_area(colour="black", size=.2, alpha=.4) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues", breaks=rev(levels(uspopage$AgeGroup)))
```

![A proportional stacked area graph](figs/rgcb_0424.png)

### Discussion

Let's take a closer look at the data and how it was summarized:

uspopage
Year AgeGroup Thousands 1900 &lt;5 9181 1900 5-14 16966 1900 15-24 14951
1900 25-34 12161 1900 35-44 9273 1900 45-54 6437 1900 55-64 4026 1900
&gt;64 3099 1901 &lt;5 9336 1901 5-14 17158 ...
We'll use ddply() to splitit into separate data frames for each
value of Year, then apply the transform() function to each piece and
calculate the Percent for each piece. Then ddply() puts all the data
frames back together:

uspopage\_prop &lt;- ddply(uspopage, "Year", transform, Percent =
Thousands / sum(Thousands) \* 100)
Year AgeGroup Thousands Percent 1900 &lt;5 9181 12.065340 1900 5-14
16966 22.296107 1900 15-24 14951 19.648067 1900 25-34 12161 15.981549
1900 35-44 9273 12.186243 1900 45-54 6437 8.459274 1900 55-64 4026
5.290825 1900 &gt;64 3099 4.072594 1901 &lt;5 9336 12.033409 1901 5-14
17158 22.115385 ...

Adding a Confidence Region {#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_REGION}
--------------------------

### Problem

You want to add a confidence region to a graph.

### Solution

Use geom_ribbon() and map values to ymin and ymax.

In the climate data set, Anomaly10y is a 10-year running average of the
deviation (in Celsius) from the average 1950â€“1980 temperature, and
Unc10y is the 95% confidence interval. We'll set ymax and ymin to
Anomaly10y plus or minus Unc10y
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-REGION)):

library(gcookbook) \# For the data set \# Grab a subset of the climate
data clim &lt;- subset(climate, Source == "Berkeley", select=c("Year",
"Anomaly10y", "Unc10y")) clim
Year Anomaly10y Unc10y 1800 -0.435 0.505 1801 -0.453 0.493 1802 -0.460
0.486 ... 2003 0.869 0.028 2004 0.884 0.029
```{r}
# Shaded region
ggplot(clim, aes(x=Year, y=Anomaly10y)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=Anomaly10y-Unc10y, ymax=Anomaly10y+Unc10y),
                alpha=0.2) +
    geom_line()
```

![A line graph with a shaded confidence region](figs/rgcb_0425.png)

The shaded region is actually a very dark grey, but it is mostly
transparent. The transparency is set with alpha=0.2, which makes it 80%
transparent.

### Discussion

Notice that the geom_ribbon() is before geom_line(),
so that the line is drawn on top of the shaded region. If the reverse
order were used, the shaded region could obscure the line. In this
particular case that wouldn't be a problem since the shaded region
is mostly transparent, but it would be a problem if the shaded region
were opaque.

Instead of a shaded region, you can also use dotted lines to represent
the upper and lower bounds
(Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-LINE-GRAPH-REGION-LINES)):

```{r}

![A line graph with dotted lines representing a confidence
region](figs/rgcb_0426.png)

Shaded regions can represent things other than confidence regions, such
as the difference between two values, for example.

In the area graphs in [section\_title](#RECIPE_LINE_GRAPH_STACKED_AREA),
the *y* range of the shaded area goes from 0 to y. Here, it goes from
ymin to ymax.
